As Eve and Chan begin building a communication system using AsyncAPI inside Chan's spaceship control room, Chan asks Eve if there is a standardised way of defining the communication system or if she defines the communication systems differently based on the particular use case.

Eve replies that AsyncAPI has a standardised way to define communication systems. 

Eve tells Chan that the communication system is defined using an AsyncAPI document in a specific structure with certain elements or components on the root level. And that the asyncAPI document structure remains the same for different types of use cases. 

As it is much easier to understand things in action, Eve explains each component of an asyncAPI document to Chan as they program each part.

## Request/reply 
As Eve and Chan almost finish setting up the communication system, Eve explains to Chan about Request/reply pattern, which is not a component but a common communication pattern. 

Eve explains Chan that this is a type of communication pattern where there are two components, a requestor and a replier. 

Here, Eve's channel is a requestor which sends a request asking Chan how is he or vice versa. And the reply address as to where the response to her request needs to be delivered is known while defining the communication system.

With the final pieces programmed and the communication system in place, Chan gets ready to get back home. 

Making a promise to stay in touch, Chan takes off in his spaceship back to [Placeholder for Chan's planet]
